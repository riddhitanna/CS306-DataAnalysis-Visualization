# CS306-Data Analysis and Visualization
 Repo for maintaining the lab work of CS306.

# Lab 1
The first lab contains basic histogram visualizations (pdfs) and observations about how to decide number of bins and bin widths in histograms for better interpretability of the visualization.

# Lab 2
The second lab explores the cumulative distribution functions (cdfs),  the Pearson correlation coefficient, interpretations from R-squared values and scatterplot smoothing. 

# Lab 3
Cleaning the data and performing the KS test to determine whether the given samples are normally distributed or not.

# Lab 4 
Ordinary least squares regression and bi-weighted least squares regression. 

# Lab 5
Using Singular Value Decomposition and EigenValue Decomposition for ellipse fitting.
