# CS306-Data Analysis and Visualization
 Repo for maintaining the lab work of CS306.

# Lab 1
The first lab contains basic histogram visualizations (pdfs) and observations about how to decide number of bins and bin widths in histograms for better interpretability of the visualization.

# Lab 2
The second lab explores the cumulative distribution functions (cdfs),  the Pearson correlation coefficient, interpretations from R-squared values and scatterplot smoothing.
